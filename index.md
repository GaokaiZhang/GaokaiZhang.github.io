## 📂 ~/about_me/

Hi there! 👋 I’m **Gaokai Zhang**. I hold dual B.S. degrees at [ZJUI](https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/en/) (CompE @ UIUC, ECE @ ZJU) and will start my MIIS master’s at CMU‑LTI in Fall 2025.

Starting from my junior year at **UIUC**, I have worked on:  
- Monte‑Carlo‑Tree‑Search planning for cost‑efficient LLM training on heterogeneous GPUs/TPUs.  
- Robustness benchmarking of LLMs ([Stochastic Monkeys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02785)).  

From July 2024 to July 2025, I joined Microsoft SRG group as an intern. At **MSRA**, I gained hands‑on experience with LLMs, RL, SFT, and business‑scale ML systems.
I contributed **LongRoPE2**—extending LLM context windows to 128 K tokens while retaining 98.5 % short‑context accuracy ([ICML 2025 poster](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20082))—and built a parallel pipeline for large‑scale user‑query processing and delivered production‑ready long‑context recommendation models to [Microsoft Asia‑Pacific R&D](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/aprd/default).

## 🧠 what_drives_me.txt
- Long‑context reasoning & scaling  
- Cloud‑optimized training architectures  
- Fine-tuning and reinforcement learning  

Outside work I’ve logged **8 000 + h** gaming 🎮 (also a lifetime **Faker** fan), vibe to rap 🎧, and hunt the perfect **omakase** bite 🍣.  

*Feel free to reach out, always happy to connect with like‑minded friends and collaborators!*
